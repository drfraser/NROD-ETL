# Railcron

A [Prefect 2.0](https://www.prefect.io/opensource/v2/) based system for fetching data from [Network Rail Open Data](https://wiki.openraildata.com//index.php?title=Main_Page)
sources

Railcron currently only handles the fetch and archive step of getting the data (e.g. train timetables) that Network Rail publishes daily or periodically.

The Prefect flows must be enhanced or additional ones created to perform subsequent ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Load) processes
(e.g. into a database).
