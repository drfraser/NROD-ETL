# Open Data Fetch

A [Prefect 2.0](https://www.prefect.io/opensource/v2/) based system for fetching data from [Network Rail Open Data](https://wiki.openraildata.com//index.php?title=Main_Page)
sources

ODFetch currently only handles the fetch and archive step of getting the daily data (e.g. train timetables) that Network Rail publishes.

The Prefect flows must be enhanced or additional ones created to perform subsequent Extraction, Transformation, and Loading processes
(e.g. into a database).
